- `flavor-core` plugin architecture: singleton bootstrap, PSR-4 autoloader, activator, deactivator, uninstall.
- Complete custom table schema (kitchen tickets as source of truth, tables, reservations, zones, availability, loyalty, OTP, SMS log, schedules).
- Custom roles: Super-admin capabilities, Branch Manager, Kitchen Staff, Cashier.
- Branch custom post type with structured meta and REST fields.
- Dining-table custom table manager and QR token model (generation UI comes in Phase 2).
- WooCommerce bridge: Toman/Rial currency layer (admin-configurable), simple-product modifier data model.
- Kitchen ticket repository (indexed operational store, synced from WooCommerce orders).
- REST API namespace `flavor/v1` with public / cookie / capability route groups.
- Theme `flavor` skeleton: RTL-first, bundled Vazirmatn, page templates, plugin-missing notice.
- Developer documentation: database schema, architecture decisions, hooks map.

### Notes

- Phase 1 foundation only. Ordering UI, kitchen dashboard views, OTP SMS, reservations UX, and the 8 demos land in later phases.
